The story of Pierre the Pear.

Pierre is from San Diego, California. He had never visited the East Coast, so he booked his first ticket to Boston. Pierre was thrilled to go to Boston, but when he went to the airport Delta had cancelled his flight. He was anxious to get on the next flight because he was afraid of missing a sombrero convention in Boston. Fortunately for Pierre, he was able to make it onto his next flight and had a great time in Boston. When asked about his favorite part, he replied with his visit to the EC544 class at BU.
