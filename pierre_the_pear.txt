The story of Pierre the Pear.

Pierre is from San Diego, California. He had never visited the East Coast, so he booked his first ticket to Boston. Pierre was thrilled to go to Boston, but when he went to the airport Delta had cancelled his flight. He was anxious to get on the next flight because he was afraid of missing a sombrero convention in Boston.
